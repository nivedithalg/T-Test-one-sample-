one-sample t-test is used to determine whether the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known population mean.  
In this example, p value is 0.23055327 and it is greater than 5% level of significance

At 95% confidence level, there is sufficient evidence to prove that mean time spent on the internet is equal to  144 minutes.
